### OrderStatus Properties and States (Python)

Source: https://ib-api-reloaded.github.io/ib_async/_modules/ib_async/order.html

Defines the OrderStatus dataclass with fields for order details and provides helper properties like 'total' and class variables for various order states (e.g., PendingSubmit, Filled, DoneStates, ActiveStates).

```python
@dataclass
class OrderStatus:
    orderId: int = 0
    status: str = ""
    filled: float = 0.0
    remaining: float = 0.0
    avgFillPrice: float = 0.0
    permId: int = 0
    parentId: int = 0
    lastFillPrice: float = 0.0
    clientId: int = 0
    whyHeld: str = ""
    mktCapPrice: float = 0.0

    @property
    def total(self) -> float:
        """Helper property to return the total size of this requested order."""
        return self.filled + self.remaining

    PendingSubmit: ClassVar[str] = "PendingSubmit"
    PendingCancel: ClassVar[str] = "PendingCancel"
    PreSubmitted: ClassVar[str] = "PreSubmitted"
    Submitted: ClassVar[str] = "Submitted"
    ApiPending: ClassVar[str] = "ApiPending"
    ApiCancelled: ClassVar[str] = "ApiCancelled"
    ApiUpdate: ClassVar[str] = "ApiUpdate"
    Cancelled: ClassVar[str] = "Cancelled"
    Filled: ClassVar[str] = "Filled"
    Inactive: ClassVar[str] = "Inactive"
    ValidationError: ClassVar[str] = "ValidationError"

    # order has either been completed, cancelled, or destroyed by IBKR's risk management
    DoneStates: ClassVar[frozenset[str]] = frozenset(
        ["Filled", "Cancelled", "ApiCancelled", "Inactive"]
    )

    # order is capable of executing at sometime in the future
    ActiveStates: ClassVar[frozenset[str]] = frozenset(
        [
            "PendingSubmit",
            "ApiPending",
            "PreSubmitted",
            "Submitted",
            "ValidationError",
            "ApiUpdate",
        ]
    )

    # order hasn't triggered "live" yet (but it could become live and execute before we receive a notice)
    WaitingStates: ClassVar[frozenset[str]] = frozenset(
        [
            "PendingSubmit",
            "ApiPending",
            "PreSubmitted",
        ]
    )

    # order is live and "working" at the broker against public exchanges
    WorkingStates: ClassVar[frozenset[str]] = frozenset(
        [
            "Submitted",
            # ValidationError can happen on submit or modify.
            # If ValidationError happens on submit, the states go PreSubmitted -> ValidationError -> Submitted (if it can be ignored automatically), so order is still live.
            # If ValidationError happens on modify, the update is just ValidationError with no new Submitted, so the previous order state remains active.

```
